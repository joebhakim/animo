            Animorl is a game about identifying animals through their taxonomic classification.
          </p>
          <p>
            Starting with Kingdom and working down to Species, youll identify the animal in the image by selecting the correct taxonomic rank at each level.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each incorrect guess adds to your score, with mistakes at higher ranks (like Kingdom) costing more points than mistakes at lower ranks (like Species). A lower score is better!
          </p>

            <p>People seem to be persistently playing this game, including insane people who can e.g. recognize birds IMMEDIATELY, so Ive been commissioned to add a TYPING BOX in which one can instantly win by entering the correct scientific name. Also added reptiles, but these are too often roadkill, so they might not last. </p>

            <p>This game became too hard, so I added an expert mode, which was the game as it was, and I play on baby mode personally. EDIT: no more possums. Too much roadkill.</p>

            <p>Added Aves, added more observations. Alex, I delegate upon you your new hobby of Bird-Expertise.</p>
